To use this example
----------------------------------------------------------
This map api takes a csv file (spreadsheet) in the format specified by the example
"PI CI and Sites_R24.xlsx". To get this format, save as .csv from Microsoft excel.

Loading place names and positions from google maps may take a while.

Once loaded and you visually see the links on the map, then the data can be saved
to .json, which removes the need for (costly) google maps queries. This example
will attempt to display such a file if the user selects it with 'choose file'.

To see an example that just displays the map, see simple.html.
